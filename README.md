# Ceng-501 Deep Learning

The syllabus of the course is added. 

We are not allowed the share out implementations to the homeworks given in this course online. However they include implementation of (1) back-propagation algorithm from scratch, (2) an autoencoder CNN using PyTorch, and (3) an easier version of Vision Transformer (ViT).
